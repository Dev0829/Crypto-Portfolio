## Work Flow
I used online JSX library such as axios, fs that enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions to fetch the data

Following is the algorithm I have implemented
1. Check error if data format or type is
2. Create the directory that returns all data such as amount, type, token
3. I used suggested API in the Git - https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ and got the latest value for per types
4. While the result are mapping by the values, I transacted the value by USD & Currency
5. Finally, I logged final data by console
